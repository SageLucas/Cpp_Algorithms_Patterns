# C++ Problem Solving & Algorithmic Patterns

This repository contains my solutions to core algorithmic challenges, implemented in modern C++. The focus is on writing clean, production-ready code while maintaining optimal time and space complexity.

## Structure
* Arrays_and_Hashing - Frequency counters, Hash Maps, and Sets.
* Two_Pointers - Linear traversals and space optimization.
* Sliding_Window - Sub-array logic and efficiency.
